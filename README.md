# Task Review and AI Classification Engine
TRACE is a toolkit for extracting structured task data from SOPs and process documentation, enabling organizations to identify high-value AI and automation opportunities across operational workflows.

# What It Does
TRACE helps operational teams:
- Extract task-level details from unstructured SOPs using LLM prompts,
- Structure data into analyzable formats for process intelligence,
- Tag tasks with potential AI/ML applications using a configurable signal pattern dictionary,
- Evaluate and improve prompt performance using gold-standard datasets, and
- Compare prompt versions and extraction quality across iterations.
