Title: Processing Participant Distribution Requests

Purpose: This procedure outlines the steps followed by the Participant Services team to review, validate, and process distribution requests submitted by plan participants.

Procedure:
1. Upon receiving a distribution request via fax or the participant portal, the associate should verify the request has all required pages and signatures.
2. The associate must review the participant’s plan notes and recent transaction history to check for any processing restrictions.
3. If required documentation is missing or incomplete, the associate should send a request for additional information to the participant using the standard communication template in Salesforce.
4. Once all necessary information is collected, enter the request into the recordkeeping system, confirm the participant’s banking instructions, and submit for processing.
5. Finally, update the workflow case status and attach all supporting documentation to the participant’s case record.

Notes:
- Common reasons for NIGO (not in good order) include missing signatures or incorrect distribution amounts.
- Use the RetirementCore system for plan data and banking confirmation; use Salesforce for communication tracking and case management.
